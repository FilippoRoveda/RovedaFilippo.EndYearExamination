You can find this repository at: [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

### Get started using this repositories:
This is a simple gameframowk that give you possibilities to make a variety of 2D game prorotype.
Basically is possible to create and extend a variety of class, such as: a main Application, some type of GameObjects and a lot of Component that modify and increase the GameObjects propierties.

This Framework is based on SFML Multymedia libreries v:2.5.1, here the link: (https://www.sfml-dev.org/).
Here some tutorial about it: (https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.5/).

## Step 1: Generate VisualStudio Solution
The repository contain only loose files without any project or solutions to work on them.
You can automatically generate a Solution based on your current version of VisualStudio following theese steps:

1) If in your PC is not already installed Premake5 download it from: (https://premake.github.io/).
2) Unzip the compress archive and put the file: premake5.exe in the same folder of your local repository.
3) Open the command line in the repository folder and here launch the command : premake5 vs(your version).
   Ex: premake5 vs2019

Now you have generated the solution and 2 sub-project:    
    -GameFramework, a Shared library project that generate .dll to link in other projects.
     You can modify it to fix and extende the current version of the Framework.
    -Sandbox, a console application to generate and test a preset level based on the current version of the Framework.

## Step 2: know the resources
In addition to the prevoius folder you can clearly see 2 of them with the names in capslock:
-FRAMEWORK
-SFML
Thoose are already setted libreries, you can use them at any moment in your own new projects, those are already dynamically linked to the 2 autogenerated project.
We have already discuss about SFML, that is the base for my framework.

## Step 2.5: FRAMEWORK documentation
Now is the moment to know more about the FRAMEWORK. 
For a rapid overview of its class hierarchy you can take a look to the UML diagram contained in the: "UML_Documentation" folder.

If you need a deeper view in the software structure you need to create some DOXYGEN documentation starting from "docgen" file in the repository folder.
